# Open Source Lab: Raycast Extension for Climbing Grade Conversion

https://github.com/MrTartuf0/climbing-grade-converter

## What is Raycast?

Raycast is a productivity tool designed to improve your workflow by providing a quick and efficient command palette. Think of it as an alternative to Spotlight on macOS, but with powerful integrations and customizable extensions. It allows users to perform actions like launching apps, managing tasks, and running scripts, all from a single keyboard shortcut. 

Similar tools exist for other operating systems: for example, **Albert** and **Ulauncher** for Linux or **Launchy** for Windows. However, Raycast sets itself apart with its rich extension ecosystem and user-friendly interface.

## The Project: Climbing Grade Conversion Extension

As a climber, I often find myself searching online for climbing grade conversions between different systems, such as V-scale, Fontainebleau (Font) scale, or Yosemite Decimal System (YDS). This task becomes repetitive and time-consuming, especially when planning outdoor trips or discussing routes with friends.

To solve this, I am developing a Raycast extension that simplifies this process. The extension will allow users to quickly convert climbing grades using natural language input. For example:

- `7b+ in Font`
- `Convert V5 to YDS`

The extension will recognize the input format, convert the grade to the desired system, and display the result instantly. Users can also copy the result to their clipboard with a single action.

## Features

- **Natural Language Input**: Enter grades in a casual format, and the extension will parse and convert them.
- **Grade System Recognition**: Automatically detect the input grading system (e.g., V-scale, Font, YDS).
- **Fast Results**: Save time by eliminating the need to search on Google.
- **Climber-Friendly**: Tailored for climbers who frequently discuss and compare grades.

## Why This Extension Matters

Climbing grades vary widely by region and system, which can lead to confusion. This tool addresses a common need in the climbing community, making it easier to communicate and plan routes. 

As someone who has repeatedly looked up grade conversions online, I believe this extension will not only save time but also enhance the climbing experience by providing a reliable and quick solution.

## Contributing to the Raycast Community

To ensure the extension meets the highest standards and integrates seamlessly with the Raycast ecosystem, I will follow the official [Raycast Developer Guide](https://developers.raycast.com/basics/getting-started). This guide provides the necessary tools and best practices to build and publish extensions, allowing me to contribute effectively to the community.


## Conclusion

This Raycast extension combines my passion for climbing with open source development, aiming to contribute to the climbing community and the Raycast ecosystem. By streamlining grade conversion, it makes climbing-related tasks more efficient and enjoyable.
